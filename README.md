# LLMs Can Discover Full Causal Graph in One Step
To explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can uncover causal relationships by leveraging embedded domain knowledge and identifying statistical patterns, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework integrates two key strategies: (1) using LLMs' domain knowledge through prompt-based full-graph discovery, and (2) employing a data-driven approach to model multivariate statistical dependencies (causal_llm) . By combining these approaches, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in causal discovery, both individually and in comparison to traditional data-driven algorithms. Our framework rigorously assesses the strengths and limitations of LLMs in causal discovery, focusing on two scenarios: utilizing domain knowledge embedded in the model and inferring causal structures purely from data without domain knowledge.
