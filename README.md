# Causal-LLM: A Unified One-Shot Framework for Prompt- and Data-Driven Causal Graph Discovery
To explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can uncover causal relationships by leveraging embedded domain knowledge and identifying statistical patterns, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework integrates two key strategies: (1) using LLMs' domain knowledge through prompt-based full-graph discovery, and (2) employing a data-driven approach to model multivariate statistical dependencies (causal_llm) . By combining these approaches, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in causal discovery, both individually and in comparison to traditional data-driven algorithms. Our framework rigorously assesses the strengths and limitations of LLMs in causal discovery, focusing on two scenarios: utilizing domain knowledge embedded in the model and inferring causal structures purely from data without domain knowledge.
